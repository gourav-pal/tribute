    ISRO, the beacon of India's space prowess, has consistently shattered celestial boundaries since its inception in 1969. From the groundbreaking Mars Orbiter Mission, asserting India's interplanetary capabilities, to the audacious deployment of 104 satellites in a single mission, ISRO has redefined the limits of possibility. Its commitment to affordability and inclusivity has not only facilitated international collaboration but has also fueled the aspirations of a burgeoning generation. As we pay homage to ISRO's visionary leadership and unparalleled achievements, one can't help but marvel at its cosmic endeavors, leaving the universe to catch up with India's sarcastically swift strides in space exploration.
